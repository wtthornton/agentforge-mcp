# Product Mission (Lite)

AgentForge is a static analyzer and project setup/migration utility that helps development teams ensure code quality, security, and standards compliance by providing comprehensive static analysis, automated compliance checking, and project scaffolding tools.

AgentForge serves development teams, DevOps engineers, and project managers who need automated quality assurance and compliance validation. Unlike generic code analysis tools, AgentForge provides Agent OS standards integration with pre-configured compliance rules, automated enforcement, and comprehensive reporting for faster adoption and consistent quality across projects.
