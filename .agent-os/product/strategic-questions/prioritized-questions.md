# Strategic Questions Prioritization

## Overview

This document prioritizes strategic questions for TappHA development based on their impact on project success, risk mitigation, resource investment, and timeline criticality. All 22 strategic questions have been comprehensively researched and answered.

## Scoring Algorithm

Each question is scored based on four criteria:
- **Project Success Impact** (0-35 points): How critical is this question to MVP success?
