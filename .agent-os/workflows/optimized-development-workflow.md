# Optimized Development Workflow - Agent OS + TappHA

## üìã **Workflow Purpose**

This document defines an optimized development workflow that integrates Agent OS framework guidelines with TappHA project requirements. It provides a streamlined process for efficient, high-quality development.

## üéØ **Workflow Overview**

### **Pre-Development Phase**
1. **Context7 Validation**: Check technology choices against Context7
2. **Framework Compliance**: Verify against Agent OS standards
3. **Project Alignment**: Ensure TappHA-specific requirements
4. **Documentation Review**: Complete and accurate documentation

### **Development Phase**
1. **Primary Reference**: Use consolidated tech stack document
2. **Context7 Validation**: Check for updates and best practices
3. **Framework Standards**: Apply when Context7 doesn't cover needs
4. **Product Requirements**: Ensure TappHA-specific needs are met

### **Post-Development Phase**
1. **Quality Check**: Verify against all three sources
2. **Documentation Update**: Update relevant documentation
3. **Lessons Learned**: Capture insights for framework improvement
4. **Framework Enhancement**: Contribute improvements back to standards
