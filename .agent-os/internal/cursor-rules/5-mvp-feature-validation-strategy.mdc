# **5. MVP Feature Validation Strategy**

### **5. MVP Feature Validation Strategy**
**Question:** How will you validate that the 9 critical MVP features actually solve the core pain point (6-12 hours/month automation management) before building the full system?

**Impact Level:** High  
**Risk:** Building wrong features could waste months of development  
**Enhancement Strategy:** Create rapid prototypes for each core feature and test with real Home Assistant users  

**Key Considerations:**
- Feature validation methodology
- User testing protocols
- Success metric definition
- Iteration feedback loops
