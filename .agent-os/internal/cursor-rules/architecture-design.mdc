### Architecture Design
- **Hybrid approach provides best of both worlds**: Dynamic execution for development with caching for performance
- **File change detection is crucial**: Eliminates manual regeneration while ensuring current content
- **Extensible architecture enables growth**: Multiple executor types can be added easily
- **Caching system improves performance**: Reduces parsing overhead for unchanged files
