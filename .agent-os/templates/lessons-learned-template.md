# Agent OS Lessons Learned Template

## Lesson Information
- **Lesson Title**: [Enter descriptive title]
- **Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Project**: [Enter project name]
- **Phase**: [Phase 1/2/3+]
- **Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
- **Category**: [Development/Process/Technology/Security/Performance/Team/Other]
- **Tags**: [Comma-separated tags for searching]

## Context
**What was the situation?**

[Provide detailed background about the situation, including:]
- What was being attempted
- What was the expected outcome
- What were the constraints or challenges
- Who was involved
- When did this occur

**Example:**
```
We were implementing the AI Suggestion Engine for TappHA Phase 2, attempting to integrate OpenAI GPT-4o Mini with Spring Boot 3.5.3. The goal was to achieve <100ms latency for AI suggestions while maintaining 90% accuracy. The team consisted of 3 developers working over 2 weeks. We encountered issues with rate limiting and response caching that significantly impacted performance.
```

## Action Taken
**What was done?**

[Describe the specific actions taken, including:]
- What approach was chosen
- What tools or technologies were used
- What decisions were made
- What was implemented
- How was it tested

**Example:**
```
We implemented a hybrid caching strategy using Redis for OpenAI responses and local TensorFlow Lite models for basic pattern recognition. We used Spring Boot's @Async for background processing and implemented circuit breakers for API rate limiting. We created comprehensive unit tests with 95% coverage and integration tests with Testcontainers.
```

## Results
**What were the outcomes?**

[Document the actual results, including:]
- What was achieved
- What metrics were met or missed
- What unexpected outcomes occurred
- What was learned from the results
- How did it compare to expectations

**Example:**
```
We achieved 85ms average latency (target: <100ms) and 92% accuracy (target: 90%). The Redis caching reduced API calls by 60% and improved response times by 40%. However, we discovered that TensorFlow Lite models required more memory than expected, leading to container size increases of 200MB. The circuit breakers prevented 95% of rate limit errors.
```

## Key Insights
**What did we learn?**

[Capture the most important insights, including:]
- What worked well and why
- What didn't work and why
- What surprised us
- What patterns emerged
- What principles were validated or challenged

**Example:**
```
1. Hybrid caching strategies are essential for AI applications - local models for speed, cloud APIs for accuracy
2. Circuit breakers are critical for external API integration - they prevent cascading failures
3. Memory usage for ML models is often underestimated - always test with realistic data volumes
4. Async processing with Spring Boot @Async works well but requires careful error handling
5. Context7 validation saved significant time by providing current best practices
```

## Recommendations
**What should we do differently?**

[Provide specific, actionable recommendations, including:]
- What should be done differently next time
- What processes should be changed
- What tools or approaches should be adopted
- What should be avoided
- What standards should be updated

**Example:**
```
1. ALWAYS implement circuit breakers for external API calls in production systems
2. ALWAYS test ML model memory usage with realistic data volumes before deployment
3. ALWAYS use hybrid caching strategies for AI applications (local + cloud)
4. ALWAYS validate technology choices against Context7 before implementation
5. ALWAYS implement comprehensive error handling for async operations
6. UPDATE Agent OS standards to include ML model memory requirements
7. CREATE template for AI service implementation with caching and circuit breakers
```
