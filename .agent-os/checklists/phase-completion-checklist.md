## Template Usage

### For Each Phase Completion
1. **Copy this checklist** for the specific phase
2. **Fill in phase-specific details** at the top
3. **Complete all mandatory steps** in order
4. **Document all metrics** before and after refactoring
5. **Get required sign-offs** from developer and reviewer
6. **Archive completed checklist** for future reference

### Quality Assurance
1. **Review checklist completion** before phase sign-off
2. **Validate all quality gates** have passed
3. **Confirm all documentation** is complete
4. **Verify all sign-offs** are obtained
5. **Archive phase completion** for audit trail

**Note**: This checklist is **MANDATORY** for all phase completions. No phase should be considered complete without this checklist being fully executed and all quality gates passing.
