# **2. Real-Time Event Processing Scale**

### **2. Real-Time Event Processing Scale**
**Question:** What's your strategy for handling high-frequency Home Assistant events (potentially 1000+ events/minute) without overwhelming the system or losing critical data?

**Impact Level:** Critical  
**Risk:** Performance bottlenecks could render monitoring system useless  
**Enhancement Strategy:** Implement event batching, priority queuing, and intelligent filtering  

**Key Considerations:**
- Event processing performance benchmarks
- Memory management for high-frequency events
- Data loss prevention mechanisms
- System resource monitoring
