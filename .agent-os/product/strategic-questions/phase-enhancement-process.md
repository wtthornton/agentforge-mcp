- **Timeline Criticality** (0-25 points): How urgent is it to answer this question?

**Total Score Range**: 0-100 points

#### 1.4 Priority Classification
- **ðŸ”´ Critical Priority (80-100 points)**: Must answer before phase implementation
- **ðŸŸ¡ High Priority (60-79 points)**: Should answer before phase implementation
- **ðŸŸ¢ Medium Priority (40-59 points)**: Important for phase success

- **Technical Evidence**: Supporting data and technical justification

**Answer Format**:
- **Answer**: YES/NO/MAYBE with clear justification
- **Evidence**: 4 key points supporting the answer
- **Recommendation**: Specific implementation guidance

#### 2.3 Research Quality Standards
