# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: MCP Server Setup
> Created: 2024-12-19

## Overview

Implement a foundational MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using Node.js and TypeScript to enable AI agent integration with .agent-os standards and project context. This server will provide the core infrastructure for dynamic AI agent communication and context management.

## User Stories

### MCP Server Foundation

As a **Developer**, I want to have a running MCP server that can handle basic agent connections, so that I can begin integrating AI agents with .agent-os functionality.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer starts the MCP server, connects an AI agent, and successfully retrieves basic project context and standards information through MCP protocol messages.

### Standards Integration

As a **DevOps Engineer**, I want the MCP server to provide access to .agent-os standards and compliance rules, so that AI agents can validate and enforce development standards automatically.

**Detailed Workflow:** DevOps engineer configures the MCP server with .agent-os standards, and AI agents can query and retrieve standards information for compliance checking and project validation.

### Context Management

As a **Project Manager**, I want the MCP server to provide real-time project context and analysis capabilities, so that AI agents can offer informed assistance based on current project state.

**Detailed Workflow:** Project manager connects AI agents to the MCP server, which provides dynamic project context including structure, dependencies, quality metrics, and compliance status.

## Spec Scope

1. **MCP Server Core** - Basic MCP protocol implementation with message handling and agent connection management
2. **Standards Integration** - Integration with existing .agent-os standards and compliance rules
3. **Context Management** - Basic project context retrieval and analysis capabilities
4. **Health Monitoring** - Server health checks and basic monitoring endpoints
5. **Configuration Management** - Environment-based configuration and MCP settings management

## Out of Scope

- Advanced workflow execution and automation
- Multi-agent load balancing and scaling
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Advanced caching and performance optimization
- Production deployment and security hardening
- Plugin system and extensibility

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Running MCP Server** - A Node.js server that starts successfully and accepts MCP protocol connections
2. **Basic MCP Functions** - Implementation of core MCP functions (getContext, getStandards, validateCompliance)
3. **Standards Access** - AI agents can retrieve .agent-os standards and compliance information
4. **Project Context** - AI agents can analyze project structure and retrieve context information
5. **Health Monitoring** - Server provides health check endpoints and basic status monitoring
