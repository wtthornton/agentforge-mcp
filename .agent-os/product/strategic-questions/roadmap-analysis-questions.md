- What's your competitive advantage over cloud-based AI platforms like Google Home, Amazon Alexa, or Samsung SmartThings?
- Have you analyzed the Home Assistant community's receptiveness to AI-driven automation management?

## 2. Technical Architecture & Scalability

### Q3: Home Assistant Integration Strategy
- How will TappHA handle Home Assistant version updates and breaking changes in the API?
- What's the fallback strategy if Home Assistant WebSocket connection fails or becomes unstable?
- How will you handle different Home Assistant installation types (Docker, supervised, core)?

### Q4: Data Privacy & Security
- Given Home Assistant users' strong privacy preferences, how will you ensure local data processing while maintaining AI capabilities?
- What's your strategy for handling sensitive automation data and user privacy concerns?
- How will you address potential security risks of autonomous automation changes?

## 3. AI/ML Strategy & User Experience

### Q5: AI Model Training & Accuracy
- How will you gather sufficient training data for behavioral modeling without violating user privacy?
- What's your strategy for handling edge cases where AI recommendations might conflict with user preferences?
- How will you measure and improve AI recommendation accuracy over time?

### Q6: User Control & Transparency
- How will users understand and trust autonomous automation changes?
- What level of transparency will you provide about AI decision-making processes?
- How will you handle situations where users want to override AI recommendations?

## 4. Business Model & Go-to-Market

### Q7: Monetization Strategy
- What's your pricing model (subscription, one-time, freemium)?
- How will you justify the value proposition to Home Assistant users who are accustomed to free tools?
- What's your strategy for enterprise customers vs. individual users?

### Q8: User Acquisition
- How will you reach the Home Assistant community effectively?
- What's your strategy for building trust with privacy-conscious users?
- How will you handle the technical complexity barrier for non-technical users?

## 5. Risk Assessment & Technical Challenges

### Q9: Technical Risks
- How will you handle the complexity of integrating with diverse Home Assistant setups and device ecosystems?
- What's your strategy for managing the performance impact of real-time AI processing on local hardware?
- How will you ensure system reliability when making autonomous automation changes?

### Q10: Market Risks
- What if Home Assistant introduces their own AI-powered automation features?
- How will you handle potential resistance from users who prefer manual control?
- What's your contingency plan if the Home Assistant ecosystem changes significantly?

## 6. Roadmap Prioritization & Validation

### Q11: MVP Validation
- Which Phase 1 features are absolutely critical for proving the core value proposition?
- How will you measure success for the MVP beyond just "successful connection"?
- What's your strategy for getting early user feedback during Phase 1?

### Q12: Feature Prioritization
- Why is "Multi-Household Learning" marked as XL effort in Phase 4? Is this the right priority?
- Should mobile application (PWA) be moved earlier in the roadmap for better user experience?
- Is the 9-12 month timeline realistic given the complexity of AI/ML features?

## 7. Success Metrics & KPIs

### Q13: Success Measurement
- How will you measure the "90% reduction in manual automation management time" claim?
- What specific KPIs will you track for each phase?
- How will you validate that AI recommendations are actually improving user experience?

### Q14: User Adoption
- What's your target user adoption rate for each phase?
- How will you handle the learning curve for users transitioning from manual to AI-driven automation?
- What's your strategy for user retention and engagement?

## Critical Priority Questions

### Most Critical Questions to Address First:

1. **User Research Validation** - Have you actually talked to Home Assistant users about their automation management pain points?

2. **Privacy Strategy** - How will you address the fundamental privacy concerns of Home Assistant users while providing AI capabilities?

3. **Technical Feasibility** - Is the autonomous automation creation technically feasible given Home Assistant's architecture and security model?

4. **Value Proposition** - Can you clearly articulate why users should trust TappHA to make autonomous changes to their home automation?

5. **Competitive Moat** - What prevents Home Assistant or other players from building similar features?
