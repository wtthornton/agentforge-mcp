## 2024-12-19: MCP Transformation Decision

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Transform .agent-os from a static framework into a Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation to enable dynamic AI agent integration, real-time context management, and enhanced development workflows.

### Context

The current .agent-os implementation provides static analysis and compliance checking, but lacks the dynamic capabilities needed for modern AI-powered development. Converting to MCP will enable:

- Real-time AI agent integration
- Dynamic context fetching and management
- Enhanced development workflow automation
- Better integration with AI development tools
- Improved scalability and extensibility

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Maintain Current Static Architecture**
   - Pros: Stable, proven, low risk
   - Cons: Limited AI integration, static capabilities, reduced competitive advantage

2. **Hybrid Approach (Partial MCP)**
   - Pros: Gradual transition, risk mitigation
   - Cons: Increased complexity, maintenance overhead, partial benefits

3. **Full MCP Transformation**
   - Pros: Maximum AI integration, future-proof architecture, competitive advantage
   - Cons: Higher initial effort, migration complexity, learning curve

### Rationale

The MCP transformation aligns with the future direction of AI-powered development tools and provides the foundation for advanced features like real-time AI assistance, dynamic context management, and enhanced workflow automation. The benefits outweigh the migration effort.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Enhanced AI integration capabilities
- Improved developer productivity
- Better competitive positioning
- Future-proof architecture
- Enhanced extensibility

**Negative:**
- Migration effort and complexity
- Learning curve for team
- Potential temporary disruption
- Resource allocation requirements

## 2024-12-19: MCP Architecture Design

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Proposed
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Architecture Team

### Decision

Implement MCP using Node.js with TypeScript, providing RESTful API endpoints for AI agent integration, real-time context management, and dynamic workflow execution.

### Context

MCP requires a robust, scalable backend that can handle multiple AI agent connections, manage context efficiently, and provide real-time responses for development workflows.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Python-based MCP**
   - Pros: Rich AI/ML ecosystem, fast prototyping
   - Cons: Performance concerns, deployment complexity

2. **Go-based MCP**
   - Pros: High performance, simple deployment
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, longer development time

3. **Node.js with TypeScript**
   - Pros: Fast development, rich ecosystem, team expertise
   - Cons: Runtime performance considerations

### Rationale

Node.js with TypeScript provides the best balance of development speed, ecosystem richness, and team expertise while maintaining the flexibility needed for MCP implementation.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Rapid development and iteration
- Rich ecosystem and tooling
- Team expertise utilization
- Easy deployment and scaling

**Negative:**
- Runtime performance considerations
- Memory usage patterns
- Event loop complexity

## 2024-12-19: MCP Feature Prioritization

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Proposed
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

Prioritize core MCP functionality over advanced features, focusing on context management, agent communication, and basic workflow execution in the initial release.

### Context

MCP transformation requires careful feature prioritization to ensure core functionality is solid before adding advanced capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Feature-Rich Initial Release**
   - Pros: Competitive advantage, user satisfaction
   - Cons: Increased complexity, longer time to market

2. **Minimal Viable MCP**
   - Pros: Faster delivery, reduced risk
   - Cons: Limited functionality, reduced competitive advantage

3. **Balanced Core + Advanced**
   - Pros: Good functionality, reasonable timeline
   - Cons: Moderate complexity, resource requirements

### Rationale

Focusing on core MCP functionality ensures a solid foundation while enabling rapid iteration and user feedback. Advanced features can be added incrementally based on user needs and feedback.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Faster time to market
- Reduced development risk
- Better user feedback integration
- Easier testing and validation

**Negative:**
- Limited initial functionality
- Potential competitive disadvantage
- User expectation management
