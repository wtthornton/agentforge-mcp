# .agent-os Reorganization Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the reorganization of the `.agent-os` directory structure to follow logical separation and improve maintainability.

## Current Problem
The existing structure has documentation and standards scattered across multiple directories, making it difficult to:
- Find specific information quickly
- Maintain consistency across related documents
- Understand the logical organization
- Navigate the framework effectively

## New Logical Structure

### 📁 `product/` - Product Management & Features
**Purpose**: All product-related information, roadmap, features, and business requirements

**Contents**:
- `ROADMAP.md` - Product roadmap and milestones
- `FEATURES.md` - Comprehensive feature list and descriptions
- `REQUIREMENTS.md` - Business and functional requirements
- `USER-STORIES.md` - User stories and acceptance criteria
- `METRICS.md` - Success metrics and KPIs
- `RELEASE-PLAN.md` - Release planning and scheduling

**Why This Makes Sense**:
- Product managers and stakeholders can find all product information in one place
- Clear separation between "what we're building" vs "how we're building it"
- Easier to maintain product vision and track progress

### 📁 `specs/` - Technical Specifications & Standards
**Purpose**: All technical specifications, standards, and implementation details

**Contents**:
- `TECHNICAL-SPECIFICATIONS.md` - System architecture and technical details
- `STANDARDS.md` - Consolidated development standards and best practices
- `API-SPECIFICATIONS.md` - API design and endpoint specifications
- `DATABASE-SCHEMAS.md` - Database design and data models
- `SECURITY-SPECIFICATIONS.md` - Security requirements and implementation
- `DEPLOYMENT-SPECIFICATIONS.md` - Infrastructure and deployment details

**Why This Makes Sense**:
- Developers can find all technical information in one place
- Clear separation between "what we're building" vs "how we're building it"
- Easier to maintain technical consistency and standards

### 📁 `standards/` - Framework Standards (Keep Existing)
**Purpose**: .agent-os framework-specific standards and rules

**Contents** (existing):
- `enforcement.md` - Compliance enforcement rules
- `feature-scoring.md` - Feature evaluation framework
- `testing-standards.md` - Testing requirements and procedures
- `code-style.md` - Code formatting and style rules

**Why This Stays**:
- These are framework-specific standards that apply to all projects
- They're used by the compliance checking tools
- They're part of the core .agent-os framework

### 📁 `tools/` - Framework Tools (Keep Existing)
**Purpose**: .agent-os framework tools and utilities

**Contents** (existing):
- `full-compliance-check.js` - Main compliance checking tool
- Other framework utilities

**Why This Stays**:
- These are core framework tools
- They're used by the compliance checking system
- They're part of the .agent-os framework functionality

## Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Create New Structure ✅
- [x] Create `product/` directory with roadmap and features
- [x] Create `specs/` directory with technical specifications
- [x] Create `specs/` directory with consolidated standards

### Phase 2: Move Existing Documents
- [ ] Move relevant documents from `documentation/` to `product/` or `specs/`
- [ ] Move relevant documents from `standards/` to `specs/` (if not framework-specific)
- [ ] Update cross-references and links

### Phase 3: Clean Up
- [ ] Remove empty directories
- [ ] Update documentation references
- [ ] Validate all links work correctly

### Phase 4: Documentation Update
- [ ] Update README files to reflect new structure
- [ ] Create navigation guides
- [ ] Update quick-start documentation

## Benefits of New Structure

### 🎯 **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- **Product**: Business requirements, features, roadmap
- **Specs**: Technical implementation details
- **Standards**: Framework rules and compliance
- **Tools**: Framework utilities and automation

### 🔍 **Easier Navigation**
- Developers know exactly where to find technical information
- Product managers know exactly where to find business information
- Clear mental model of the organization

### 🧹 **Better Maintainability**
- Related documents are grouped together
- Easier to keep documentation in sync
- Reduced duplication and inconsistency

### 📚 **Improved Onboarding**
- New team members can quickly understand the structure
- Clear learning path from product to technical details
- Better documentation discoverability

## Directory Structure After Reorganization

└── README.md                  # Main framework documentation
```

## Implementation Notes

### File Naming Convention
- Use UPPERCASE for main category files (e.g., `ROADMAP.md`)
- Use lowercase for specific topic files (e.g., `api-specifications.md`)
- Use hyphens for multi-word filenames

### Cross-References
- Update all internal links to reflect new structure
- Use relative paths for cross-references
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible

### Documentation Standards
- Each directory should have a README explaining its purpose
- Use consistent formatting and structure across all documents
- Include table of contents for long documents

## Success Metrics

### 📊 **Immediate Benefits**
- [ ] All product information accessible in one location
- [ ] All technical specifications accessible in one location
- [ ] Clear separation between business and technical concerns

### 📈 **Long-term Benefits**
- [ ] Reduced time to find information
- [ ] Improved documentation consistency
- [ ] Better onboarding experience for new team members
- [ ] Easier maintenance and updates

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Phase 1**: Finish creating the new structure
2. **Begin Phase 2**: Start moving existing documents
3. **Update References**: Fix all broken links and references
4. **Validate Structure**: Ensure the new organization works as intended
5. **Team Communication**: Inform team members of the new structure

## Conclusion

This reorganization will significantly improve the usability and maintainability of the `.agent-os` framework documentation. By clearly separating product concerns from technical specifications, we create a more intuitive and efficient development experience.

The new structure follows industry best practices for documentation organization and will scale better as the framework grows and evolves.
