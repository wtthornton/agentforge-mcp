# **4. User Control Framework Granularity**

### **4. User Control Framework Granularity**
**Question:** How will you implement the granular control system to accommodate the 4 different user segments (23% early adopters, 45% cautious, 25% skeptical, 7% resistant) with their varying approval requirements?

**Impact Level:** High  
**Risk:** Wrong approach could alienate entire user segments  
**Enhancement Strategy:** Create adaptive UI/UX that adjusts based on user control preferences  

**Key Considerations:**
- User segmentation implementation
- Adaptive approval workflows
- Safety limit configurations
- User preference persistence
