# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-06-advanced-pattern-analysis/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Data Processing Infrastructure
- **Time-Series Query Engine**: Implement optimized InfluxDB queries using Flux for multi-dimensional time aggregations
- **Data Pipeline Architecture**: Spring Boot async processing with @Async and CompletableFuture for parallel pattern analysis
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis-based caching with 24-hour TTL for computed patterns and 5-minute TTL for real-time queries
- **Batch Processing**: Spring @Scheduled tasks running every 5 minutes for pattern computation
- **Query Optimization**: Materialized views in PostgreSQL for frequently accessed pattern summaries

### Pattern Recognition Algorithms
- **Statistical Analysis**: Implement moving averages, standard deviation, and seasonality detection using Apache Commons Math
- **Frequency Analysis**: Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for identifying periodic patterns in device usage
- **Anomaly Detection**: Z-score and Isolation Forest algorithms for outlier detection
- **Correlation Analysis**: Pearson correlation for identifying device interaction patterns
- **Time Clustering**: K-means clustering for grouping similar time periods

### Performance Criteria
- **Query Response Time**: P95 < 100ms for pattern retrieval APIs
- **Batch Processing Time**: Complete pattern analysis for 100K events in < 30 seconds
- **Memory Usage**: < 500MB heap allocation for pattern processing
- **Concurrent Processing**: Support 50 concurrent pattern analysis requests
- **Cache Hit Ratio**: > 80% for frequently accessed patterns

### Data Dimensions and Granularity
- **Hourly Patterns**: 24-hour cycle analysis with 15-minute granularity
- **Daily Patterns**: 7-day week analysis with hourly granularity
- **Weekly Patterns**: 4-week month analysis with daily granularity
- **Monthly Patterns**: 12-month year analysis with weekly granularity
- **Yearly Patterns**: Multi-year trends with monthly granularity

### API Response Formats
- **Pattern Summary**: JSON structure with pattern type, confidence score, frequency, and time ranges
- **Anomaly Reports**: Detailed anomaly information with severity levels and contextual data
- **Correlation Matrix**: Device interaction correlations in matrix format
- **Time Series Data**: Aggregated metrics in time-bucketed format compatible with frontend charts

### Error Handling and Resilience
- **Circuit Breaker**: Hystrix/Resilience4j for preventing cascade failures
- **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Graceful Degradation**: Return cached results when real-time processing fails
- **Data Validation**: Input sanitization and boundary checks for all time range queries

## External Dependencies

- **Apache Commons Math 3.6.1** - Statistical analysis and mathematical computations
- **Justification:** Industry-standard library for statistical operations, avoiding custom implementation of complex algorithms

- **Spring Boot Starter Data Redis** - Caching layer for pattern results
- **Justification:** Required for sub-100ms response times with high-volume pattern queries

- **Resilience4j 2.2.0** - Circuit breaker and resilience patterns
- **Justification:** Modern replacement for Hystrix, providing fault tolerance for pattern analysis pipeline
