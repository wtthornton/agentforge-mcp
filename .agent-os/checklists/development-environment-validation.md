  - [ ] Package dependencies installed
  - [ ] TypeScript compilation successful

- [ ] **Test Configuration**
  - [ ] Test framework properly configured
  - [ ] Mock services available
  - [ ] API endpoint connectivity

## Development Workflow Validation

### üîß Service Isolation Testing
- [ ] **Independent Service Startup**
  - [ ] Core services start without optional dependencies
  - [ ] Application gracefully handles missing services
  - [ ] Development workflow unblocked by service issues

- [ ] **Dependency Chain Analysis**
  - [ ] Critical path dependencies identified
  - [ ] Optional dependencies clearly marked
  - [ ] Fallback mechanisms tested

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Validation
- [ ] **Migration Status**
  - [ ] Flyway enabled for development environment
  - [ ] Latest migration scripts applied successfully
  - [ ] Schema version consistency verified

- [ ] **Entity Testing**
  - [ ] JPA entities compile successfully
  - [ ] Repository tests pass with current schema
  - [ ] Foreign key relationships validated

- [ ] **Test Data Management**
  - [ ] Test database isolated from development
  - [ ] Sample data available for development
  - [ ] Data cleanup procedures documented

## Issue Resolution Procedures

### üö® Critical Issue Protocols

#### Service Startup Failures
1. **Immediate Assessment**
   - [ ] Check container logs: `docker logs service_name --tail 20`
   - [ ] Verify port conflicts
   - [ ] Confirm configuration syntax

2. **Isolation Strategy**
   - [ ] Start core services first: `docker-compose up -d postgres influxdb`
   - [ ] Add optional services incrementally
   - [ ] Use `--no-deps` flag for problematic services

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - [ ] Disable problematic service temporarily
   - [ ] Use embedded alternatives (H2 database, in-memory cache)
   - [ ] Document workaround for team knowledge

#### Compilation/Build Failures
1. **Immediate Diagnosis**
   - [ ] Check build tool output for specific errors
   - [ ] Verify dependency versions
   - [ ] Confirm annotation processing

2. **Common Fix Patterns**
   - [ ] Lombok annotations: Ensure class-level annotations uncommented
   - [ ] Kafka dependencies: Exclude auto-configurations if service unavailable
   - [ ] Database connections: Verify connection strings and credentials

3. **Recovery Steps**
   - [ ] Clean build artifacts: `mvn clean` or `npm run clean`
   - [ ] Update dependencies: Check for version conflicts
   - [ ] Restart development environment

### üìä Environment Health Monitoring

#### Continuous Validation
- [ ] **Service Health Checks**
  - [ ] Automated health endpoints configured
  - [ ] Regular connectivity testing
  - [ ] Performance baseline established

- [ ] **Resource Monitoring**
  - [ ] Memory usage within acceptable limits
  - [ ] CPU utilization normal
  - [ ] Disk space sufficient

- [ ] **Development Productivity Metrics**
  - [ ] Build time acceptable (< 2 minutes for incremental)
  - [ ] Test execution time reasonable (< 30 seconds for unit tests)
  - [ ] Hot reload functionality working
