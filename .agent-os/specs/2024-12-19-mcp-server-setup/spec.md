# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: MCP Server Setup
> Created: 2024-12-19

## Overview

Implement a foundational MCP (Model Context Protocol) server using Node.js and TypeScript to enable AI agent integration with .agent-os standards and project context. This server will provide the core infrastructure for dynamic AI agent communication and context management.

## User Stories

### MCP Server Foundation

As a **Developer**, I want to have a running MCP server that can handle basic agent connections, so that I can begin integrating AI agents with .agent-os functionality.

**Detailed Workflow:** Developer starts the MCP server, connects an AI agent, and successfully retrieves basic project context and standards information through MCP protocol messages.

### Standards Integration

As a **DevOps Engineer**, I want the MCP server to provide access to .agent-os standards and compliance rules, so that AI agents can validate and enforce development standards automatically.

**Detailed Workflow:** DevOps engineer configures the MCP server with .agent-os standards, and AI agents can query and retrieve standards information for compliance checking and project validation.

### Context Management

As a **Project Manager**, I want the MCP server to provide real-time project context and analysis capabilities, so that AI agents can offer informed assistance based on current project state.

**Detailed Workflow:** Project manager connects AI agents to the MCP server, which provides dynamic project context including structure, dependencies, quality metrics, and compliance status.

## Cursor Agent Management

### Agent Rotation Strategy

To ensure optimal performance and fresh context for each development task, the project implements a **mandatory agent rotation strategy** using Cursor's AI assistant capabilities.

**Core Principle:** Each subtask requires a fresh AI agent to maintain context clarity and avoid conversation length limitations.

### Agent Types and Responsibilities

1. **Static Analyzer Agent** (`@static-analyzer`)
   - Code quality and compliance checking
   - Standards validation and enforcement
   - Project structure analysis
   - **Use Case**: Code review, compliance checking, architecture validation

2. **Database Agent** (`@database-agent`)
   - PostgreSQL schema management
   - Database optimization and performance
   - Migration and backup strategies
   - **Use Case**: Database design, performance tuning, migration planning

3. **Frontend Agent** (`@frontend-agent`)
   - React 19 and TypeScript development
   - UI/UX optimization and accessibility
   - Component architecture and state management
   - **Use Case**: Component development, UI optimization, frontend testing

4. **Backend Agent** (`@backend-agent`)
   - Spring Boot 3.3 and Java 21 development
   - API design and implementation
   - Service layer architecture
   - **Use Case**: API development, service implementation, backend testing

5. **Infrastructure Agent** (`@infrastructure-agent`)
   - Docker and containerization
   - CI/CD pipeline management
   - Monitoring and alerting setup
   - **Use Case**: Deployment configuration, monitoring setup, infrastructure optimization

### Agent Rotation Requirements

**MANDATORY FOR ALL SUBTASKS:**
- **Fresh Agent**: Start new conversation for each subtask
- **Specialized Context**: Use appropriate agent type for the task
- **Clear Scope**: Define single, focused objective per conversation
- **Context Reset**: Clear previous conversation context before new task
- **Quick Closure**: End conversation after task completion

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **Conversation Management**
   - Use `Ctrl+Shift+N` for new conversation on each subtask
   - Clear context with `Ctrl+Shift+C` before starting new task
   - Set conversation focus to single, well-defined objective

2. **Agent Selection**
   - Choose agent type based on subtask requirements
   - Use agent-specific prompts for specialized assistance
   - Rotate agents to maintain fresh perspective

3. **Context Provision**
   - Provide relevant file context for each request
   - Include specific error messages or requirements
   - Reference relevant standards or documentation

4. **Quality Assurance**
   - Verify agent response quality and relevance
   - Request clarification if agent context seems unclear
   - Document successful agent patterns for future use

## Spec Scope

1. **MCP Server Core** - Basic MCP protocol implementation with message handling and agent connection management
2. **Standards Integration** - Integration with existing .agent-os standards and compliance rules
3. **Context Management** - Basic project context retrieval and analysis capabilities
4. **Health Monitoring** - Server health checks and basic monitoring endpoints
5. **Configuration Management** - Environment-based configuration and MCP settings management
6. **Cursor Agent Management** - Agent rotation strategy and conversation management for optimal development workflow

## Out of Scope

- Advanced workflow execution and automation
- Multi-agent load balancing and scaling
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Advanced caching and performance optimization
- Production deployment and security hardening
- Plugin system and extensibility

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Running MCP Server** - A Node.js server that starts successfully and accepts MCP protocol connections
2. **Basic MCP Functions** - Implementation of core MCP functions (getContext, getStandards, validateCompliance)
3. **Standards Access** - AI agents can retrieve .agent-os standards and compliance information
4. **Project Context** - AI agents can analyze project structure and retrieve context information
5. **Health Monitoring** - Server provides health check endpoints and basic status monitoring
6. **Agent Management** - Documented agent rotation strategy and conversation management guidelines
