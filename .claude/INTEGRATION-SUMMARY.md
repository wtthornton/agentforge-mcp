## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Before Starting Work
Claude Code automatically:
1. Loads all cursor rules and Agent OS standards
2. Validates project context and constraints
3. Checks compliance status
4. Prepares development environment

### During Development
Claude Code automatically:
1. Follows Controller → Service → Repository pattern
2. Enforces code style and architecture standards
3. Validates technology choices against Context7
4. Maintains quality gates and performance targets

### After Changes
Claude Code automatically:
1. Runs compliance checks
2. Updates progress tracking
3. Validates Context7 compliance
4. Captures lessons learned

## 🔧 Available Commands

### Quick Access
```bash
# Compliance check
node .agent-os/tools/compliance-checker.js --detailed

# Feature scoring
node .agent-os/tools/feature-scoring/feature-scorer.js

# Setup validation
node .agent-os/scripts/setup.js validate

# Real-time monitoring
node .agent-os/tools/real-time-monitor.js

# Dashboard view
node .agent-os/tools/enhanced-dashboard.js
```

## 📊 Quality Targets

Claude Code automatically enforces:
- **Compliance Score**: ≥85%
- **Backend Response Time**: P95 ≤200ms
- **Frontend TTI**: ≤1.8s
- **Code Quality**: ≤5 TODO items per service
- **Test Coverage**: ≥85%
- **Security**: 0 vulnerabilities, 100% compliance

## 🎯 Project Constraints

Claude Code strictly enforces:
- **NO AI suggestion features** - Static analyzer only
- **NO dynamic AI processing** - No real-time AI analysis
- **NO AI-driven automation** - No AI-controlled workflows
- **NO machine learning features** - No ML model training or inference
- **NO AI chat interfaces** - No conversational AI features

## 🏗️ Architecture Requirements

Claude Code automatically enforces:
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.3+ (Java 21 LTS) with Controller → Service → Repository pattern
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript 5, functional components and hooks
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector extension
- **Containerization**: Docker 24 with multi-stage builds

## 🔄 Continuous Improvement

Claude Code automatically:
- Runs weekly comprehensive compliance checks
- Captures lessons learned after each development session
- Analyzes statistical metrics for optimization
- Reviews feature scoring and phase progression
- Updates standards based on Context7 best practices

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Claude Code is now identical** to Cursor in terms of rules and standards
2. **All development automatically follows** Agent OS standards and cursor rules
3. **No manual intervention required** - everything runs automatically
4. **Full compliance enforcement** with zero friction development
5. **Context7 integration** is mandatory and automatic

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:
1. **Check compliance status**: `node .agent-os/tools/compliance-checker.js --detailed`
2. **Validate cursor rules**: Ensure `.cursor/rules/` files are accessible
3. **Check Agent OS standards**: Verify `.agent-os/standards/` directory structure
4. **Run setup validation**: `node .agent-os/scripts/setup.js validate`

## 🎉 Ready to Use!

Claude Code is now fully integrated and ready for seamless development with the same standards as Cursor. You can:

- **Start coding immediately** with full access to all tools and standards
- **Use the same commands** you would in Cursor
- **Follow the same development patterns** and workflows
- **Maintain the same code quality** and compliance standards

**No additional setup required - everything is ready to go! 🚀**
