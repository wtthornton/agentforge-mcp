# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Advanced Pattern Analysis  
> Created: 2025-08-06

## Overview

Implement a multi-dimensional time-series analysis system that detects complex behavioral patterns across varying time intervals (1 day to 1 year) in Home Assistant event data. This feature will analyze device usage patterns, identify recurring behaviors, and provide the foundation for intelligent automation recommendations with 85-90% accuracy targets.

## User Stories

### Power User Pattern Optimization

As a Home Assistant power user, I want to understand my home's behavioral patterns across different time scales, so that I can optimize my automations based on actual usage data rather than guesswork.

The system analyzes my device interactions over the past year, identifying patterns like "weekday morning routines" that differ from weekend behaviors. It detects that my coffee maker is used at 6:30 AM on weekdays but 8:45 AM on weekends, my lights follow specific sequences, and my thermostat adjustments correlate with weather patterns. This multi-dimensional analysis reveals optimization opportunities I never noticed, such as pre-heating patterns that could save energy or lighting sequences that could be automated based on seasonal changes.

### Anomaly Detection for Security

As a security-conscious homeowner, I want to detect unusual patterns in my home's behavior, so that I can identify potential security issues or system malfunctions.

The pattern analysis system continuously monitors device behavior against established baselines. When it detects anomalies - like doors opening at unusual times, unexpected device activations, or deviations from normal patterns - it flags these for review. For example, if my garage door typically opens between 5-7 PM on weekdays but suddenly opens at 2 AM, the system identifies this as an anomaly worth investigating, helping me maintain both security and system reliability.

### Seasonal Pattern Recognition

As a home automation enthusiast, I want to understand how my home usage changes with seasons and holidays, so that I can create more intelligent, context-aware automations.

The system analyzes patterns across months and seasons, identifying how my behavior changes throughout the year. It recognizes that my heating patterns shift in winter, my outdoor lighting usage varies with daylight hours, and my entertainment system usage increases during holiday periods. This long-term pattern recognition enables the creation of seasonal automation templates that automatically adjust to changing conditions without manual intervention.

## Spec Scope

1. **Time-Series Data Pipeline** - Build a robust data processing pipeline that handles high-volume event streams from InfluxDB and PostgreSQL with sub-second query performance
2. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis Engine** - Implement pattern detection algorithms that analyze data across 5 time dimensions (daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, yearly) with configurable granularity
3. **Pattern Recognition Algorithms** - Deploy statistical and machine learning models for identifying recurring patterns, correlations, and anomalies with 85-90% accuracy
4. **Performance Optimization System** - Create caching layers and query optimization strategies to maintain <100ms response times for pattern queries
5. **Pattern Visualization API** - Develop REST endpoints that provide pattern data in formats suitable for frontend visualization and AI consumption

## Out of Scope

- Real-time pattern detection (will use batch processing with 5-minute intervals)
- Pattern-based automation creation (handled by separate Automation Recommendation Engine)
- Direct Home Assistant automation deployment (requires separate implementation)
- Historical data migration from existing Home Assistant databases
- Custom machine learning model training interface

## Expected Deliverable

1. REST API endpoints that return pattern analysis results with <100ms response time for any time range query
2. Batch processing system that analyzes patterns every 5 minutes and stores results for instant retrieval
3. Pattern accuracy validation showing 85-90% accuracy in detecting recurring behaviors across test datasets
