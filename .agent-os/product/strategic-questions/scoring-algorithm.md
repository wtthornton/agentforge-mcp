# Strategic Questions Scoring Algorithm

## Overview

This document defines the scoring algorithm used to prioritize strategic questions for TappHA project success. Each question is scored from 1-100 based on multiple weighted factors.

## Scoring Framework

### Core Scoring Factors (Total: 100 points)

#### 1. **Project Success Impact** (40 points)
- **Critical to MVP Success** (30-40 points)
- **Important for Market Fit** (20-30 points)
- **Nice to Have** (10-20 points)
- **Low Impact** (1-10 points)

#### 2. **Risk Mitigation** (25 points)
- **High Risk - Could Kill Project** (20-25 points)
- **Medium Risk - Could Delay/Significantly Impact** (10-20 points)
- **Low Risk - Minor Impact** (1-10 points)

#### 3. **Resource Investment** (20 points)
- **High Investment Required** (15-20 points)
- **Medium Investment Required** (8-15 points)
- **Low Investment Required** (1-8 points)

#### 4. **Timeline Criticality** (15 points)
- **Must Answer Before Phase 1** (12-15 points)
- **Must Answer Before Phase 2** (8-12 points)
- **Must Answer Before Phase 3** (4-8 points)
- **Can Answer Later** (1-4 points)

## Scoring Criteria Details

### Project Success Impact (40 points)

#### Critical to MVP Success (30-40 points)
- Questions that directly impact whether the MVP will be successful
- Core value proposition validation
- Essential technical feasibility questions
- Critical user acceptance factors

#### Important for Market Fit (20-30 points)
- Questions that affect product-market fit
- Competitive positioning questions
- User segmentation and targeting
- Business model validation

#### Nice to Have (10-20 points)
- Questions that improve the product but aren't critical
- Optimization and enhancement questions
- Future feature planning

#### Low Impact (1-10 points)
- Questions that have minimal impact on project success
- Nice-to-have features
- Long-term planning questions

### Risk Mitigation (25 points)

#### High Risk - Could Kill Project (20-25 points)
- Questions that, if not addressed, could cause project failure
- Technical feasibility risks
- Market acceptance risks
- Legal/regulatory risks

#### Medium Risk - Could Delay/Significantly Impact (10-20 points)
- Questions that could cause significant delays or major changes
- User adoption risks
- Competitive response risks
- Resource allocation risks

#### Low Risk - Minor Impact (1-10 points)
- Questions with minimal risk to project success
- Optimization opportunities
- Future planning considerations

### Resource Investment (20 points)

#### High Investment Required (15-20 points)
- Questions requiring significant research, development, or testing
- Questions that need external expertise or tools
- Questions requiring user research or market analysis

#### Medium Investment Required (8-15 points)
- Questions requiring moderate research or analysis
- Questions that can be answered with existing resources
- Questions requiring some external input

#### Low Investment Required (1-8 points)
- Questions that can be answered quickly with available information
- Questions requiring minimal research or analysis
- Questions that can be answered internally

### Timeline Criticality (15 points)

#### Must Answer Before Phase 1 (12-15 points)
- Questions that must be resolved before MVP development
- Core architecture decisions
- Critical user research questions
- Essential market validation

#### Must Answer Before Phase 2 (8-12 points)
- Questions that must be resolved before intelligence engine development
- AI/ML strategy questions
- Advanced feature planning
- User experience design questions

#### Must Answer Before Phase 3 (8-12 points)
- Questions that must be resolved before autonomous management
- Advanced AI implementation questions
- User trust and control questions
- Performance and scalability questions

#### Can Answer Later (1-4 points)
- Questions that can be addressed in later phases
- Future feature planning
- Long-term strategy questions
- Optimization opportunities

## Scoring Process

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
1. Review each question against the scoring criteria
2. Assign points for each factor (Project Success Impact, Risk Mitigation, Resource Investment, Timeline Criticality)
3. Calculate total score (sum of all factors)

### Step 2: Validation and Adjustment
1. Review scores for consistency across similar questions
2. Adjust scores based on project-specific factors
3. Validate scores with stakeholders

### Step 3: Final Prioritization
1. Sort questions by total score (highest to lowest)
2. Group questions by priority levels:
   - **Critical (80-100 points)**: Must address immediately
   - **High (60-79 points)**: Address in current phase
   - **Medium (40-59 points)**: Address in next phase
   - **Low (1-39 points)**: Address when resources permit

## Example Scoring

### Example Question: "Have you conducted user research with Home Assistant power users to validate the 5-10 hours/month automation management pain point?"

- **Project Success Impact**: 35 points (Critical to MVP Success)
- **Risk Mitigation**: 20 points (High Risk - Could Kill Project)
- **Resource Investment**: 15 points (High Investment Required)
- **Timeline Criticality**: 15 points (Must Answer Before Phase 1)
- **Total Score**: 85 points (Critical Priority)

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use This Algorithm:
- Before starting any major development phase
- When prioritizing research activities
- When allocating resources to different areas
- When planning stakeholder reviews

### How to Apply the Algorithm:
1. **Score Questions**: Apply the scoring criteria to each question
2. **Review Scores**: Validate scores for consistency and accuracy
3. **Prioritize Actions**: Focus on highest-scoring questions first
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor how addressing high-priority questions impacts project success

### Expected Outcomes:
- Clear prioritization of strategic questions
- Efficient resource allocation
- Reduced project risks
- Improved decision-making process
