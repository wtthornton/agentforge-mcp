# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Event Monitoring System
> Created: 2025-01-27

## Overview

Implement real-time monitoring of all Home Assistant events and data streams with Kafka integration and intelligent filtering to achieve 60-80% volume reduction. This system will process high-frequency events (1000+ events/minute) with <100ms processing latency while maintaining comprehensive event tracking for pattern analysis and automation insights.

## User Stories

### Real-Time Event Processing

As a TappHA user, I want my Home Assistant events to be processed in real-time with intelligent filtering, so that I can receive meaningful insights about my home automation patterns without being overwhelmed by irrelevant data.

The system will connect to the Home Assistant WebSocket API, process incoming events through Kafka for high-throughput streaming, apply intelligent filtering algorithms to reduce noise, and store relevant events for pattern analysis while maintaining <100ms processing latency.

### Intelligent Event Filtering

As a TappHA user, I want the system to automatically filter out routine or irrelevant events, so that I can focus on meaningful patterns and automation opportunities without data overload.

The system will implement multi-layer filtering including frequency-based filtering, pattern recognition, and user-defined preferences to achieve 60-80% volume reduction while preserving critical events for analysis.

### Event Analytics Dashboard

As a TappHA user, I want to view real-time event analytics and filtering statistics, so that I can understand how my home automation system is performing and what patterns are being detected.

The system will provide a real-time dashboard showing event processing statistics, filtering effectiveness, and key metrics about home automation patterns with visual representations of event frequency and trends.

## Spec Scope

1. **Kafka Integration** - Set up Apache Kafka for high-throughput event streaming with proper partitioning and consumer groups
2. **Event Processing Pipeline** - Implement real-time event processing with Spring Boot async processing and WebSocket message handling
3. **Intelligent Filtering System** - Create multi-layer filtering algorithms for 60-80% volume reduction with configurable rules
4. **Event Storage & Analytics** - Store filtered events in PostgreSQL with pgvector for pattern analysis and time-series metrics
5. **Real-Time Dashboard** - Build React dashboard for event monitoring with live statistics and filtering effectiveness metrics
6. **Performance Monitoring** - Implement comprehensive monitoring with Spring Boot Actuator and custom metrics for event processing performance

## Out of Scope

- Advanced AI pattern recognition (Phase 2 feature)
- User-defined automation rules (Phase 3 feature)
- Cross-household event analysis (Phase 4 feature)
- Voice integration for event monitoring
- Mobile app for event monitoring
- Third-party integrations beyond Home Assistant

## Expected Deliverable

1. Successfully process 1000+ events/minute with <100ms latency through Kafka integration
2. Achieve 60-80% event volume reduction through intelligent filtering algorithms
3. Provide real-time event analytics dashboard with filtering statistics and performance metrics
4. Store filtered events in PostgreSQL with proper indexing for pattern analysis
5. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting for event processing performance
