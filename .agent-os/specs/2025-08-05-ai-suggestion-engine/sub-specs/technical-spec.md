# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-05-ai-suggestion-engine/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Hybrid AI Processing Architecture
- **Local AI Processing**: Implement TensorFlow Lite 2.13+ models for basic pattern classification and filtering with <100ms inference time
- **Cloud AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-4o Mini API integration for complex suggestion generation with fallback to GPT-3.5 Turbo
- **Model Quantization**: Implement 75% memory reduction through model quantization for local processing
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis-based caching for AI responses with 40% performance improvement target

### Batch Processing Engine
- **Scheduling System**: Spring Boot @Scheduled annotations for configurable batch intervals (default: every 6 hours)
- **Queue Management**: Kafka-based message queuing for processing reliability and scalability
- **Pattern Data Integration**: REST API calls to Advanced Pattern Analysis service for behavioral data input
- **Processing Pipeline**: Multi-stage pipeline with data validation, AI processing, and result storage

### Suggestion Management System
- **Suggestion Storage**: PostgreSQL entities with JPA/Hibernate for suggestion lifecycle management
- **User Approval Tracking**: Audit trail system for all user decisions with timestamp and reasoning storage
- **Batch Status Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of batch processing status with progress indicators
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with retry mechanisms and failure notifications

### Web Interface Requirements
- **React Dashboard**: Suggestion review interface with shadcn/ui components and TailwindCSS styling
- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live suggestion notifications and status updates
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Mobile-first design with responsive breakpoints for all screen sizes
