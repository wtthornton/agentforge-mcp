# Agent OS Sub-Task Tracking Update Summary

**Document**: Agent OS Template Updates for Sub-Task Tracking  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Completed  
**Owner**: Development Team  

## Overview

Updated Agent OS templates and standards to enforce sub-task specification tracking as part of the development workflow.

## Updated Files

### 1. `.agent-os/standards/enforcement.md`
**Changes Made:**
- Added new section: "Sub-Task Specification Management"
- Updated enforcement rules to include sub-task specification updates
- Added validation checklist for sub-task updates
- Made sub-task specification updates MANDATORY

**Key Requirements Added:**
```markdown
- **MANDATORY**: Update sub-task specifications in `.agent-os/specs/*/tasks.md` immediately
- **NEVER** complete a subtask without updating BOTH tasks.md AND sub-task specifications
- **ALWAYS** maintain sync between main tasks.md and sub-task specifications
```

### 2. `.agent-os/checklists/code-review-checklist.md`
**Changes Made:**
- Added requirement #5: "Sub-task specifications updated"
- Added new section: "Sub-Task Specification Verification"
- Updated sign-off requirements to include sub-task verification

**Key Requirements Added:**
```markdown
### Sub-Task Specification Verification
- [ ] **Main tasks.md updated**: All completed work reflected
- [ ] **Sub-task specs updated**: Related `.agent-os/specs/*/tasks.md` files marked complete
- [ ] **Sync verified**: Main tasks align with sub-task specifications
- [ ] **No orphaned sub-tasks**: All implemented features have corresponding sub-task updates
```

### 3. `.agent-os/templates/task-list-template.md`
**Changes Made:**
- Added mandatory sub-task specification update requirement
- Added new section: "Sub-Task Specification Tracking"
- Added "Dual Update Requirements" workflow
- Updated progress documentation template
- Enhanced validation checklist

**Key Requirements Added:**
```markdown
#### Sub-Task Specification Tracking
**CRITICAL**: For every completed implementation, IMMEDIATELY update sub-task specifications:

# In main tasks.md
- [x] 2.1 Implement hybrid AI processing coordinator

# MUST ALSO UPDATE in .agent-os/specs/YYYY-MM-DD-*/tasks.md
- [x] 2.1 Write tests for AI service components and hybrid processing
- [x] 2.4 Build hybrid AI processing coordinator with local-first strategy
```

## Workflow Impact

### Before These Updates
1. Developers completed tasks
2. Updated main `tasks.md` file
3. Sub-task specifications in `.agent-os/specs/*/tasks.md` remained outdated

### After These Updates
1. Developers complete tasks
2. **IMMEDIATELY** update main `tasks.md` file
3. **IMMEDIATELY** update corresponding sub-task specifications in `.agent-os/specs/*/tasks.md`
4. **VERIFY** both files are synchronized
5. **REFERENCE** both updates in commit messages
6. **CODE REVIEW** includes verification of sub-task specification updates

## Benefits

### 1. Accurate Project Tracking
- Sub-task specifications always reflect actual implementation status
- No orphaned or outdated sub-task items
- Clear visibility into project progress at all levels

### 2. Improved Collaboration
- Team members can see exactly what's implemented vs. planned
- Handoffs between developers include complete task status
- Project managers have accurate progress information

### 3. Quality Assurance
- Code reviews include verification of task completion
- Documentation stays in sync with implementation
- Prevents "completed but not documented" scenarios

### 4. Historical Accuracy
- Accurate record of what was actually implemented
- Better project retrospectives and lessons learned
- Improved estimation for future projects

## Implementation Notes

### Immediate Action Required
All existing projects should:
1. Review current sub-task specifications in `.agent-os/specs/*/tasks.md`
2. Update specifications to reflect actual implementation status
3. Ensure main `tasks.md` and sub-task specifications are synchronized

### Going Forward
All developers must:
1. Follow the dual update requirement (main tasks + sub-task specs)
2. Include sub-task specification updates in all PRs
3. Verify synchronization during code reviews
4. Reference task updates in commit messages

## Compliance Enforcement

### Code Review Gates
- PRs cannot be approved without sub-task specification verification
- Reviewers must check both main tasks and sub-task specifications
- Merge blocks if task tracking is incomplete

### Development Workflow
- Sub-task specification updates are now MANDATORY, not optional
- Development sessions must include task tracking updates
- End-of-session checklists include sub-task verification

## Validation

### Before Merging Any PR
- [ ] Main `tasks.md` reflects completed work
- [ ] Related `.agent-os/specs/*/tasks.md` files updated
- [ ] Both files are synchronized
- [ ] No orphaned incomplete sub-tasks
- [ ] Commit messages reference task updates

### Before Ending Development Session
- [ ] All completed work reflected in task files
- [ ] Sub-task specifications updated
- [ ] Progress notes documented
- [ ] Next steps clearly identified
