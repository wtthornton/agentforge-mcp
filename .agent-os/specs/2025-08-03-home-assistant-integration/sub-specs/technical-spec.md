# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-03-home-assistant-integration/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Implementation (Spring Boot 3.5.3 + Java 21)

- **Home Assistant API Client**: Implement REST client using Spring WebClient with connection pooling and timeout configuration
- **WebSocket Connection**: Use Spring WebSocket client with STOMP protocol for real-time event subscription
- **Version Detection**: Implement API endpoint discovery to detect Home Assistant version and available features
- **Authentication**: Spring Security with OAuth 2.1 integration for secure token management
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling with @ControllerAdvice and automatic retry logic
- **Connection Management**: Connection pooling, health checks, and automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- **Event Processing**: Kafka integration for high-throughput event processing with intelligent filtering
- **Monitoring**: Spring Boot Actuator + Micrometer for real-time metrics and health monitoring

### Frontend Implementation (React 19 + TypeScript 5.5)

- **Connection Status Dashboard**: Real-time display of Home Assistant connection status and health metrics
- **Event Monitoring Interface**: Live event stream display with filtering and search capabilities
- **Configuration Management**: Secure form for Home Assistant URL and authentication token input
- **Error Display**: User-friendly error messages with troubleshooting guidance
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design with TailwindCSS 4.x + shadcn/ui components

### Database Requirements

- **Connection Configuration**: Store Home Assistant connection details securely with encryption
- **Event Storage**: PostgreSQL 17 for structured event data with pgvector for embeddings
- **Time Series Data**: InfluxDB 3 Core for high-frequency event metrics and performance monitoring
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive logging of all connection attempts and API interactions

### Security Requirements

- **Token Encryption**: Secure storage of Home Assistant authentication tokens using Spring Security
- **HTTPS/TLS**: All communications must use TLS 1.3 with proper certificate validation
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all user inputs and API responses
- **OWASP Compliance**: Follow OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
- **Container Hardening**: Secure Docker container configuration with minimal attack surface

### Performance Requirements

- **Connection Latency**: <100ms for API calls, <200ms for WebSocket message processing
- **Event Throughput**: Handle 1000+ events/minute with intelligent filtering (60-80% volume reduction)
- **Memory Usage**: <30% of available memory for connection management
- **CPU Usage**: <20% for event processing and monitoring
- **Response Time**: <2s for user interface interactions

### Integration Points

- **Home Assistant REST API**: Multi-version support for API endpoints and authentication
- **Home Assistant WebSocket API**: Real-time event subscription with state_changed events
- **Kafka Event Stream**: High-throughput event processing pipeline
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Structured data storage with JPA/Hibernate
- **InfluxDB Time Series**: Performance metrics and monitoring data
- **Prometheus Metrics**: Custom metrics for connection health and performance monitoring
