# Agent-OS Feature Scoring Framework

## Overview
This framework provides systematic criteria for evaluating and prioritizing features in Agent-OS development. It ensures resources are allocated to maximum impact features that directly improve developer productivity and code quality.

## Mandatory Scoring Criteria

All features must be scored on a 1-10 scale across four dimensions:

### 1. Business Impact (1-10)
**How much does this improve Agent-OS effectiveness?**

- **10/10**: Critical for Agent-OS core mission - significantly improves compliance, standards adoption, or code quality
- **8-9/10**: High business value - measurably improves key Agent-OS metrics
- **6-7/10**: Moderate business value - supports Agent-OS goals with measurable impact
- **4-5/10**: Low business value - minimal measurable improvement to Agent-OS effectiveness
- **1-3/10**: No clear business value - nice-to-have or convenience feature

### 2. Developer Productivity (1-10)
**How much faster/better will developers code with this feature?**

- **10/10**: Dramatically improves coding speed - saves hours per week per developer
- **8-9/10**: Significantly improves productivity - saves 30+ minutes per day per developer
- **6-7/10**: Moderately improves productivity - saves 10-30 minutes per day per developer
- **4-5/10**: Minimal productivity improvement - saves <10 minutes per day per developer
- **1-3/10**: No direct productivity improvement - motivational or awareness only

### 3. Implementation Complexity (1-10)
**How difficult is this to build and maintain?**

- **10/10**: Extremely complex - requires new architecture, external integrations, or advanced algorithms
- **8-9/10**: High complexity - significant development effort, complex testing, ongoing maintenance
- **6-7/10**: Moderate complexity - standard development patterns, manageable scope
- **4-5/10**: Low complexity - straightforward implementation, minimal dependencies
- **1-3/10**: Very simple - basic CRUD operations, configuration changes, or UI updates

### 4. Adoption Likelihood (1-10)
**How likely are developers to actively use this feature?**

- **10/10**: Essential feature - developers will use daily as part of core workflow
- **8-9/10**: High adoption - developers will use regularly (weekly) when needed
- **6-7/10**: Moderate adoption - developers will use occasionally (monthly) for specific needs
- **4-5/10**: Low adoption - developers might use rarely or only when reminded
- **1-3/10**: Minimal adoption - developers unlikely to use without enforcement

## Implementation Thresholds

### Phase 1: Core Features (Immediate Implementation)
**Criteria**: Must meet ONE of the following:
- **Developer Productivity ≥ 8/10** (maximum impact on coding speed)
- **Combined Score ≥ 32/40** (80%+ overall score)
- **Business Impact ≥ 9/10 AND Adoption Likelihood ≥ 8/10** (critical features)

### Phase 2: Enhancement Features (Next Implementation)
**Criteria**: Must meet ONE of the following:
- **Developer Productivity ≥ 7/10** (high impact on coding speed)
- **Combined Score ≥ 28/40** (70%+ overall score)
- **Business Impact ≥ 8/10 AND Implementation Complexity ≤ 5/10** (high value, manageable effort)

### Phase 3+: Future Features (Deferred Implementation)
**Criteria**: All other features
- **Combined Score < 28/40** or **Developer Productivity < 7/10**
- Requires executive approval for implementation
- Should be reviewed quarterly for potential elimination

## Automatic Elimination Criteria

Features meeting ANY of the following criteria should be automatically deferred or eliminated:

- **Developer Productivity < 6/10** - No significant coding speed improvement
- **Combined Score < 24/40** - Below 60% overall value threshold
- **Implementation Complexity ≥ 8/10 AND Developer Productivity ≤ 6/10** - High effort, low productivity impact
- **Adoption Likelihood ≤ 4/10** - Unlikely to be used by developers

## Scoring Process

### 1. Initial Scoring
- **Who**: Product owner + lead developer + 2 team members
- **When**: During feature planning, before development estimation
- **Format**: Individual scoring followed by consensus discussion

### 2. Scoring Review
- **Frequency**: Bi-weekly during sprint planning
- **Purpose**: Re-evaluate features based on new information or changing priorities
- **Outcome**: Confirm, adjust, or eliminate features from roadmap

### 3. Post-Implementation Review
- **When**: 30 days after feature release
- **Purpose**: Validate scoring accuracy and improve future scoring
- **Metrics**: Actual adoption rates, productivity improvements, developer feedback

## Scoring Template

```markdown
## Feature: [Feature Name]

### Scoring
- **Business Impact**: [1-10] - [Justification]
- **Developer Productivity**: [1-10] - [Justification]
- **Implementation Complexity**: [1-10] - [Justification]
- **Adoption Likelihood**: [1-10] - [Justification]
- **Combined Score**: [Total]/40

### Threshold Analysis
- **Phase Classification**: [Phase 1/2/3+]
- **Implementation Decision**: [Proceed/Defer/Eliminate]
- **Priority Ranking**: [High/Medium/Low]

## Example Scoring

### High-Impact Feature Example
**Feature**: Inline Violation Highlighting in Cursor Editor

- **Business Impact**: 9/10 - Directly improves compliance by catching violations during coding
- **Developer Productivity**: 9/10 - Saves 30+ minutes/day by preventing violation cleanup cycles
- **Implementation Complexity**: 7/10 - Requires Cursor API integration and real-time processing
- **Adoption Likelihood**: 9/10 - Developers will see immediate value in their daily workflow
- **Combined Score**: 34/40

**Decision**: Phase 1 - Immediate Implementation (Developer Productivity ≥ 8/10)

### Low-Impact Feature Example
**Feature**: Compliance Milestone Celebration Notifications

- **Business Impact**: 3/10 - Motivational only, no direct compliance improvement
- **Developer Productivity**: 3/10 - No coding speed improvement
- **Implementation Complexity**: 3/10 - Simple notification system
- **Adoption Likelihood**: 4/10 - Developers may find notifications annoying
- **Combined Score**: 13/40

**Decision**: Eliminate (Developer Productivity < 6/10, Combined Score < 24/40)

## Quality Assurance

### Scoring Accuracy Validation
- **Developer Surveys**: Post-implementation adoption and satisfaction surveys
- **Usage Analytics**: Track actual feature usage vs predicted adoption likelihood
- **Productivity Metrics**: Measure actual time savings vs predicted productivity impact

### Continuous Improvement
- **Monthly Scoring Reviews**: Adjust criteria based on historical accuracy
- **Team Calibration**: Regular sessions to align scoring interpretation across team members
- **Framework Updates**: Evolve criteria as Agent-OS matures and team learns

## Integration with Development Process

### Sprint Planning Integration
1. **Feature Proposal**: Include scoring in all feature requests
2. **Backlog Prioritization**: Sort by combined score and developer productivity impact
3. **Sprint Selection**: Prioritize Phase 1 features, limit Phase 2 features, eliminate Phase 3+ features

### Resource Allocation Guidelines
- **80% effort** on Phase 1 features (8-10/10 productivity impact)
- **20% effort** on Phase 2 features (7/10 productivity impact)
- **0% effort** on Phase 3+ features until Phase 1-2 are complete

### Stakeholder Communication
- **Feature Requests**: Require scoring justification for all requests
- **Executive Reviews**: Present features by phase with clear impact rationale
- **Team Communication**: Use scoring to explain prioritization decisions
