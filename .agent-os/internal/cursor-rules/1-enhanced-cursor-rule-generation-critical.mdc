### 1. **Enhanced Cursor Rule Generation (CRITICAL)**
- [x] 1.1 **Extend existing cursor-integration.js**
  - [x] 1.1.1 Add automatic rule generation from .md lessons learned using vanilla JavaScript
  - [ ] 1.1.2 Implement rule effectiveness tracking with JSON storage
  - [ ] 1.1.3 Add rule optimization based on usage patterns
  - [x] 1.1.4 **Update lessons learned** - Capture insights from enhanced Cursor rule generation implementation
  - **Progress Note**: âœ… Successfully implemented automatic rule generation from .md lessons learned. Processed 20 lesson files and generated 6 rules. Key insights: metadata extraction needs to be flexible to handle various lesson formats, path resolution is critical for cross-platform compatibility, and template literals in HTML strings need proper escaping.
