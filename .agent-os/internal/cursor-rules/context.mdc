## Context
Implemented comprehensive lessons learned framework improvements with automatic categorization, quality validation, and template generation. The framework now includes three core tools: lesson-categorizer.js, lesson-quality-validator.js, and lesson-template-generator.js. Need to capture key insights and lessons learned from the implementation process to inform production deployment.
