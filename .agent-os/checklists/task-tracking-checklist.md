# Task Tracking Checklist

## Overview
This checklist ensures proper task tracking and progress documentation throughout development sessions.

## Pre-Session Checklist

### Before Starting Development
- [ ] Review current tasks.md file for project status
- [ ] Identify next priority tasks to work on
- [ ] Verify task file structure meets standards
- [ ] Check for any incomplete task updates from previous sessions

## During Development Session

### For Each Subtask Completed
- [ ] **IMMEDIATELY** mark the subtask as `[x]` in tasks.md
- [ ] Add progress note with detailed description of what was accomplished
- [ ] Include timestamp of completion
- [ ] **RUN COMPLIANCE CHECK**: Execute `node compliance-checker.js --detailed`
- [ ] Verify compliance score remains â‰¥85% after changes
- [ ] Address any new violations before proceeding
- [ ] Document compliance status in progress notes
- [ ] Note any issues or challenges encountered
- [ ] Document any dependencies or blockers discovered
- [ ] **CAPTURE LESSONS LEARNED** if significant insights gained (see `@~/.agent-os/lessons-learned/README.md`)

### Progress Documentation Standards
```markdown
- [x] 1.1 Write tests for new database entities
  - **Progress Note**: Unit tests implemented with 95% coverage for HomeAssistantEvent entity

## End-of-Session Checklist

### Session Summary Documentation
- [ ] Add session summary section with timestamp
- [ ] List all completed subtasks with descriptions
- [ ] Identify next priority tasks
- [ ] Update overall progress percentage
- [ ] Document any remaining work or blockers

### Session Summary Template
```markdown
## Session Summary - YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM

## Task File Structure Validation

### Required Sections Check
- [ ] **Tasks** section with numbered major sections
- [ ] **Recent Completion Summary** section
- [ ] **Next Priority Tasks** section
- [ ] **Overall Progress** section with percentage
- [ ] **Session Summary** sections (if applicable)

### Content Quality Check
- [ ] Task names are clear and descriptive
- [ ] Progress notes provide sufficient technical detail
- [ ] Completion status is accurate and up-to-date
- [ ] Next steps are clearly defined
- [ ] Progress percentages are calculated correctly

## Integration with Development Workflow

### Commit Message Integration
- [ ] Reference task numbers in commit messages
- [ ] Include brief description of task completion
- [ ] Link to relevant documentation or issues

### Pull Request Integration
- [ ] Include task updates in PR description
- [ ] Reference completed tasks in PR comments
- [ ] Update task status based on PR review feedback

### Documentation Cross-Reference
- [ ] Link tasks.md to related documentation
- [ ] Update README files with task progress
- [ ] Cross-reference with technical specifications
- [ ] Update project roadmap based on task completion

## Error Prevention

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- [ ] Don't wait until end of session to update tasks
- [ ] Don't use vague or incomplete progress notes
- [ ] Don't forget to update completion percentages
- [ ] Don't skip session summaries
- [ ] Don't leave tasks in inconsistent state

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Review task updates for accuracy
- [ ] Verify technical details in progress notes
- [ ] Ensure chronological order of updates
- [ ] Check for missing or incomplete information
- [ ] Validate progress calculations

## Continuous Improvement

### Regular Reviews
- [ ] Weekly review of task tracking quality
- [ ] Monthly assessment of task structure effectiveness
- [ ] Quarterly evaluation of task tracking process
- [ ] Annual review of task tracking standards

### Feedback Integration
- [ ] Collect feedback on task tracking effectiveness
- [ ] Incorporate improvements to task structure
- [ ] Update standards based on team feedback
- [ ] Refine task tracking process based on usage patterns
