# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: AI Suggestion Engine
> Created: 2025-08-05

## Overview

Implement an intelligent AI suggestion engine that generates automation improvement recommendations based on Home Assistant behavioral patterns using a hybrid local-cloud AI strategy with OpenAI GPT-4o Mini. This engine will provide batched suggestion generation with simple approve/reject workflows to improve home automation efficiency and reduce manual configuration time.

## User Stories

### Automated Suggestion Generation

As a Home Assistant power user, I want to receive intelligent automation suggestions based on my usage patterns, so that I can improve my home automation efficiency without spending hours analyzing data myself.

The system will analyze behavioral patterns from the Pattern Analysis service and generate contextual automation suggestions through batch processing. Users will receive notifications about new suggestions and can review them through a dedicated dashboard interface.

### Simple Approval Workflow

As a Home Assistant user, I want to easily approve or reject AI-generated automation suggestions, so that I maintain control over my home automation system while benefiting from AI insights.

Users can review suggestions with clear explanations, see the proposed automation changes, and approve/reject suggestions with a single click. Approved suggestions will be implemented automatically with full audit trails.

### Safety and Transparency

As a security-conscious user, I want to understand exactly what changes the AI is proposing and have the ability to reverse them, so that I feel confident using AI automation suggestions.

The system will provide clear explanations for each suggestion, show before/after automation configurations, and maintain complete audit logs of all changes with rollback capabilities.

## Spec Scope

1. **Hybrid AI Processing** - Implement local TensorFlow Lite models for basic pattern recognition with OpenAI GPT-4o Mini for complex suggestion generation
2. **Batch Suggestion Engine** - Create scheduled batch processing system that analyzes patterns and generates automation suggestions at regular intervals
3. **Simple Approval Interface** - Build user-friendly dashboard for reviewing and approving/rejecting suggestions with clear explanations
4. **Database Schema** - Design new tables for storing suggestions, user approvals, processing status, and audit trails
5. **REST and WebSocket APIs** - Implement endpoints for suggestion management and real-time notification delivery

## Out of Scope

- Advanced multi-level approval workflows (future enhancement)
- Real-time suggestion generation (batch processing only)
- Complex safety validation beyond basic syntax checking
- Integration with Advanced Pattern Analysis component (separate dependency)
- Granular user segment approval preferences (simple approve/reject only)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional AI suggestion engine that generates 3-5 relevant automation suggestions per batch cycle with 90% technical accuracy
2. Complete web interface allowing users to review, approve, and reject suggestions with clear explanations and impact previews
3. Comprehensive audit system tracking all suggestion generation, user decisions, and implementation results with rollback capabilities
