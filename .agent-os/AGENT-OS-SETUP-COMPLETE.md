## How It Works

### 1. Pre-Development Checklist
Every new agent **MUST** complete these steps:
```bash
# 1. Read fundamentals
# Read @~/.agent-os/AGENT-OS-FUNDAMENTALS.md completely

# 2. Run compliance check
node .agent-os/tools/full-compliance-check.js

# 3. Review standards
# Check all standards in .agent-os/standards/
```

### 2. Development Workflow
**ALWAYS** follow this structured process:
1. **Load Context** - Load relevant spec, tasks.md, and standards
2. **Check Compliance** - Run compliance checker before starting
3. **Execute Tasks** - Follow Controller → Service → Repository pattern
4. **Update Progress** - Immediately update tasks.md after each subtask
5. **Run Tests** - Ensure all tests pass before proceeding
6. **Validate Compliance** - Run compliance checker after completion
7. **Update Lessons Learned** - Capture insights for future improvements

### 3. Compliance Requirements
- **Critical Violations:** 0 (blocking)
- **Overall Compliance Score:** ≥85%
- **Security Compliance:** 100%
- **Testing Coverage:** ≥85%
- **Code Quality Score:** ≥80%

## Key Principles

### 1. Standards First, Automation Always
- **ALWAYS** check standards before making decisions
- **NEVER** deviate from standards without justification
- **ALWAYS** use automated compliance checking
- **ALWAYS** validate against compliance requirements

### 2. Mandatory Technology Stack
**ALWAYS** use these technologies:
- **Backend:** Spring Boot 3.3+ (Java 21 LTS) with REST + gRPC + async events (Kafka)
- **Frontend:** React 19 stable with TypeScript 5
- **Database:** PostgreSQL 17 with pgvector extension
- **Time Series:** InfluxDB 3 Core (Docker)
- **AI/ML:** OpenAI GPT-4o, pgvector, LangChain 0.2
- **Build:** Vite 5.x, TailwindCSS 4.x + shadcn/ui
- **State:** TanStack Query 5, Context API
- **Runtime:** Docker 24, Compose V2
- **Observability:** Prometheus v2.50, Grafana 11, Loki 3

### 3. Code Generation Patterns
**ALWAYS** follow established patterns for:
- **Backend Code** - Spring Boot with Controller → Service → Repository pattern
- **Frontend Code** - React with functional components and hooks
- **Database Code** - JPA/Hibernate with PostgreSQL
- **AI/ML Code** - OpenAI integration with proper error handling
- **Testing Code** - Comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Compliance Checking

### Automated Tools
**ALWAYS** use the built-in compliance checking tools:
```bash
# Full compliance check
node .agent-os/tools/full-compliance-check.js

# Real-time validation
node .agent-os/tools/cursor-integration.js watch

# Generate compliance report
node .agent-os/tools/compliance-checker.js --report
```

### Compliance Categories
1. **Technology Stack** - Verify correct versions and dependencies
2. **Code Style** - Check formatting, naming conventions, structure
3. **Security** - Detect vulnerabilities, hardcoded secrets
4. **Architecture** - Verify patterns and design principles
5. **Testing** - Ensure adequate coverage and test quality
6. **Performance** - Check for performance issues and optimizations

## Task Tracking Standards

### Mandatory Task Updates
**ALWAYS** update tasks.md immediately after completing any subtask:
- Mark completed subtasks with `[x]` immediately after completion
- Add progress notes for completed sections
- Update completion percentages and overall progress
- Document session summaries with completed tasks and next priorities

### Task File Structure
- **Required Sections:** Tasks, Recent Completion Summary, Next Priority Tasks, Overall Progress
- **Progress Documentation:** Include timestamps, detailed descriptions, and next steps
- **Quality Standards:** Clear task names, sufficient detail, chronological order
- **Integration:** Reference tasks.md in development workflow and documentation

## Strategic Questions Framework

### Strategic Questions Location
**ALWAYS** save strategic questions in `.agent-os/product/strategic-questions/` directory:
- Use template format from `qa-template.md`
- Include proper document metadata
- Organize by logical categories
- Include critical priority questions clearly

### Strategic Questions Research
**ALWAYS** conduct deep research using multiple data sources:
- Follow answer template format from `answer-template.md`
- Save answer documents in `answers/` directory with timestamped filenames
- Provide evidence-based answers with comprehensive research findings
- Include implementation-ready recommendations

## Lessons Learned Integration

### Capture Process
**ALWAYS** capture lessons learned after each task:
1. **Document Insights** - What worked, what didn't, why
2. **Update Standards** - Modify standards based on new insights
3. **Improve Processes** - Enhance workflows and checklists
4. **Share Knowledge** - Update documentation and templates
