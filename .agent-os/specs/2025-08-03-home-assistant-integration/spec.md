# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Home Assistant Integration
> Created: 2025-08-03

## Overview

Establish secure connection to Home Assistant API and WebSocket using Spring Boot REST client with multi-version compatibility and comprehensive version detection. This foundational feature will enable TappHA to communicate with Home Assistant instances and monitor real-time events for intelligent automation analysis.

## User Stories

### Home Assistant Connection Management

As a TappHA user, I want to securely connect my Home Assistant instance to TappHA, so that I can begin monitoring my home automation system for intelligent insights and recommendations.

The user will provide their Home Assistant URL, authentication token, and connection preferences. TappHA will establish a secure connection, validate the Home Assistant version, and begin monitoring events in real-time while maintaining privacy through local-only processing.

### Multi-Version Compatibility

As a TappHA user with an older Home Assistant installation, I want TappHA to work with my existing setup without requiring upgrades, so that I can immediately benefit from intelligent automation features regardless of my Home Assistant version.

TappHA will automatically detect the Home Assistant version, adapt its API calls accordingly, and provide graceful degradation for unsupported features while maintaining core functionality.

### Real-Time Event Monitoring

As a TappHA user, I want to see my Home Assistant events being monitored in real-time, so that I can verify the connection is working and understand what data TappHA is analyzing.

The system will display real-time event monitoring status, connection health metrics, and event processing statistics through a clean web interface while maintaining complete privacy through local-only processing.

## Spec Scope

1. **Home Assistant API Client** - Implement Spring Boot REST client with multi-version Home Assistant API support and comprehensive error handling
2. **WebSocket Connection Management** - Establish secure WebSocket connections for real-time event monitoring with authentication and reconnection logic
3. **Version Detection & Compatibility** - Automatically detect Home Assistant version and implement appropriate API compatibility layer
4. **Authentication & Security** - Implement secure token-based authentication with OAuth 2.1 integration and credential management
5. **Connection Health Monitoring** - Real-time monitoring of connection status, latency, and event processing metrics
6. **Error Handling & Recovery** - Comprehensive error handling with automatic retry logic and graceful degradation

## Out of Scope

- Advanced AI/ML features (Phase 2)
- Automation creation or modification (Phase 3)
- Third-party integration discovery
- Mobile application development
- Voice interface integration
- Multi-household support

## Expected Deliverable

1. Successfully connect to Home Assistant API and WebSocket with multi-version compatibility
2. Monitor and process 1000+ events/minute with <100ms processing latency
3. Maintain secure authentication with comprehensive error handling and automatic recovery
4. Provide real-time connection status and health metrics through web interface
