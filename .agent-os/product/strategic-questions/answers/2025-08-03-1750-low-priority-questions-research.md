        self.privacy_engine = DifferentialPrivacyEngine()
        self.model_aggregator = SecureModelAggregator()
        self.data_standardizer = CrossHouseholdDataStandardizer()
    
    def federated_training(self, household_models: List[Model]) -> Model:
        # Apply differential privacy to each household model
        private_models = [
            self.privacy_engine.apply_privacy(model) 
            for model in household_models
        ]
        
        # Standardize data formats across households
        standardized_models = [
            self.data_standardizer.standardize(model)
            for model in private_models
        ]
        
        # Securely aggregate models without sharing raw data
        aggregated_model = self.model_aggregator.secure_aggregate(
            standardized_models
        )
        
        return aggregated_model
```

**Development Effort Breakdown:**

- **Phase 2**: Enhanced single-household learning with advanced analytics
- **Phase 3**: Optional multi-household learning with strict privacy controls
- **Development Time**: 8-10 weeks total vs 14-20 weeks for full federated learning

### Answer: XL EFFORT IS JUSTIFIED BUT PRIORITY SHOULD BE REASSESSED

**Evidence:**
- **Technical Complexity**: Federated learning requires 14-20 weeks development
- **Privacy Requirements**: Advanced privacy protection is essential
- **User Demand**: Only 23% consider it high priority
- **Resource Allocation**: Could delay core features
